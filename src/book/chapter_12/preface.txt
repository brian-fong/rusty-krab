Unlike Newton's mechanics, or Maxwell's electrodynamics, or Einstein's
relativity, quantum theory was not created—or even definitively
packaged—by one individual, and it retains to this day some of the
scars of its exhilirating but traumatic youth. There is no general
consensus as to what its fundamental principles are, how it should be
taught, or what it really "means". Every competent physicist can "do"
quantum mechanics, but the stories we tell ourselves about what we are
doing are as various as the tales of Scheherazade, and almost as
implausible. Richard Feynman (one of the greatest practitioners)
remarked, "I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum
mechanics.""
